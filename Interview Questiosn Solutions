Assume you're given a table containing information about Wayfair user transactions for different products. Write a query to calculate the year-on-year growth rate for the total spend of each product, grouping the results by product ID.

The output should include the year in ascending order, product ID, current year's spend, previous year's spend and year-on-year growth percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.

- My Solution:
    WITH cte_YoY_Growth AS(
      SELECT
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) AS year,
      product_id,
      SUM(spend) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id,EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date)
              ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date)) AS current_year_spend
      FROM user_transactions
    ORDER BY   
     product_id,EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date))
    SELECT
      year,
      product_id,
      current_year_spend,
      LAG(current_year_spend,1) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY year) AS prev_year_spend,
      ROUND(100 * ((current_year_spend / LAG(current_year_spend,1) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY year)) -1 ),2) AS yoy_rate
    FROM cte_YoY_Growth;
